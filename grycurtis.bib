% This file, grypiotr.bib, started as a 2006/2/11 copy from gry.bib,
% and evolved from there.

%  never end typeout commands with period or punctuation,
%  as causes bibtex to leave ouot punctuation in paper!!!!
%
% conventions:
%
%
%  alphabetical by FULL names (so all edith are before all lanes),
%  not by labels!!!!!
%
%
%  perscomm for pers comms  (regarding month/date see below)
%
% IN TITLES:  Cap second word of hyphenation... e.g. Self-Reducible, but
%	no brackets... not Self-{R}educible.
% DO upper-case (cap) first word of subtitles:  Style: {T}en Lessons

%  NO MONTHS in articles BUT journal volume AND number when available....
%  Months in manuscripts if available
%  Months in conf when avail
%  MONTHS in TRs when available
%  MONTHS in perscomms; if date too then exactly like this month={October~12,},


%  for http addresses... mbox them but don't \tt them!
%  no address for conferences, but addresses in theses and TRs
% For TOAPPEAR PROCS--- no year field, note={To appear, 199X}
%  USE Manuscript  DONT USE Unpublished manuscript
%
%  In journals with issue having 2 numbers, use number = {2--3}, NOT
%                                           {2\&3} or (2/3).
%
% in to appear JOURNAL articles, or anything else, don't use a cite-in-
% a-cite, but instead just include it, for example (NOTE WAY YEAR IS
% DEALT WITH):
%  note={To appear.  Preliminary version appears
%	in {\em Proceedings of the 6th Structure in
%        Complexity Theory Conference (1991)}, IEEE Computer Society Press,
%	pp.~220--229}
% OR
% note={Preliminary version
%appears in {\em Proceedings of the 7th (1989) Conference on
%                Fundamentals of Computation Theory}, Springer-Verlag
%{\it Lecture Notes in Computer Science \#380}, pp. 35--46.},
%
%
%
%   to change in TR entries from "tech report" to something else,
%   one can use things like:
%         type = "Research Report",
%
% Note:  bibtex gets Dutch names right unless you confuse it:
%	NO BAD!!!! Good NO BAD =   J. van Helden  alphabetizes under V BUT
%  WAIT... maybe that is ok... latex companion says use the above
%    essentially always... and latex KNOWS what van is and will
%    follow the style file.
% 	Bad=	J. {van Helden}
%       maybe right: {J. van} Helden  ACTUALLY really right would be to hand-specific the key... sigh  SO use no braces at all, see first example above!
%
%  says an online guide, rather self-contradictorily:
%          Van, van, van den, van der, and von: usually put under V, but sometimes under the family name.
%             Vanderberg: spelled as an English word; put under V.
%             van der Waals: spelled as a Dutch word; put under W.
%             Jan van der Meer von Delft is known in English as Jan Vermeer: put under V.
%
% and in my labels ignore van, e.g., emd-tor (van emde boas and torenvliet)
%  and regarding names with hyphens, try to do: C.~St.~J.~A.~{Nash-Williams}
% since that gives the label Nas78 rather than NW78.

% ACCENTS in bibtex (from the web bibtex advice site):
% When using BibTeX, the interaction between
% names and accenting is somewhat tricky.
% You should use `G{\"o}del' or `G{\"{o}}del', and
% not `{G{\"{o}}del}' or `{G\"{o}del}'.

  abstract =     "Controlled stochastic systems occur in science engineering, manufacturing, social sciences, and many  other contexts. If the systems is modeled as a Markov  decision process (MDP) and will run {\/ad infinitum},  the optimal control policy can be computed in  polynomial time using linear programming. The problems  considered here assume that the time that the process  will run is finite, and based on the size of the input.  There are many factors that compound the complexity of  computing the optimal policy. For instance, there are  many factors that compound the complexity of this  computation. For instance, if the controller does not   have complete information about the state of the system, or if the system is represented in some very  succinct manner, the optimal policy is provably not  computable in time polynomial in the size of the input.   We analyze the computational complexity of evaluating  policies and of determining whether a sufficiently good policy exists for a MDP, based on a number of  confounding factors, including the observability of the   system state; the succinctness of the representation;   the type of policy; even the number of actions relative to the number of states. In almost every case, we show that the decision problem is complete for some known complexity class. Some of these results are familiar from work by Papadimitriou and Tsitsiklis and others, but some, such as our PL-completeness proofs, are surprising. We include proofs of completeness for natural problems in the as yet little-studied classes ${\rm NP}^{PP}$.",

  abstract =     "We show that every language in NP has a probablistic verifier that checks membership proofs for it using logarithmic number of random bits and by examining a {\em constant\/} number of bits in the proof. If a string is in the language, then there exists a proof such that the verifier accepts with probability 1 (i.e., for every choice of its random string). For strings not in the language, the verifier rejects every provided ``proof'' with probability at least 1/2. Our result builds upon and improves a recent result of Arora and Safra [1998] whose verifiers examine a nonconstant number of bits in the proof (though this number is a very slowly growing function of the input length).\par As a consequence, we prove that no MAX SNP-hard problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme, unless NP = P. The class MAX SNP was defined by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [1991] and hard problems for this class include vertex cover, maximum satisfiability, maximum cut, metric TSP, Steiner trees and shortest superstring. We also improve upon the clique hardness results of Feige et al. [1996] and Arora and Safra [1998] and show that there exists a positive [epsilon] such that approximating the maximum clique size in an $N$-vertex graph to within a factor of $N^\epsilon$ is NP-hard.",

Obfuscators, if they                 exist, would have a wide variety of cryptographic and                 complexity-theoretic applications, ranging from                 software protection to homomorphic encryption to                 complexity-theoretic analogues of Rice's theorem. Most                 of these applications are based on an interpretation of                 the ``unintelligibility'' condition in obfuscation as                 meaning that $O(P)$ is a ``virtual black box,'' in the                 sense that anything one can efficiently compute given                 $O(P)$, one could also efficiently compute given oracle                 access to $P$. In this work, we initiate a theoretical                 investigation of obfuscation. Our main result is that,                 even under very weak formalizations of the above                 intuition, obfuscation is impossible. We prove this by                 constructing a family of functions $F$ that are                 \emph{inherently unobfuscatable} in the following                 sense: there is a property $\pi : F \rightarrow                 \{0,1\}$ such that (a) given \emph{any program} that                 computes a function $f\in F$, the value $\pi(f)$ can be                 efficiently computed, yet (b) given \emph{oracle                 access} to a (randomly selected) function $f\in F$, no                 efficient algorithm can compute $\pi(f)$ much better                 than random guessing. We extend our impossibility                 result in a number of ways, including even obfuscators                 that (a) are not necessarily computable in polynomial                 time, (b) only \emph{approximately} preserve the                 functionality, and (c) only need to work for very                 restricted models of computation ($TC_0$). We also rule                 out several potential applications of obfuscators, by                 constructing ``unobfuscatable'' signature schemes,                 encryption schemes, and pseudorandom function                 families},

  abstract =     "In multiagent settings where the agents have different                 preferences, preference aggregation is a central issue.                 Voting is a general method for preference aggregation,                 but seminal results have shown that all general voting                 protocols are manipulable. One could try to avoid                 manipulation by using voting protocols where                 determining a beneficial manipulation is hard                 computationally. The complexity of manipulating                 realistic elections where the number of candidates is a                 small constant was recently studied (Conitzer 2002),                 but the emphasis was on the question of whether or not                 a protocol becomes hard to manipulate for some constant                 number of candidates. That work, in many cases, left                 open the question: How many candidates are needed to                 make elections hard to manipulate? This is a crucial                 question when comparing the relative manipulability of                 different voting protocols. In this paper we answer                 that question for the voting protocols of the earlier                 study: plurality, Borda, STV, Copeland, maximin,                 regular cup, and randomized cup. We also answer that                 question for two voting protocols for which no results                 on the complexity of manipulation have been derived                 before: veto and plurality with runoff. It turns out                 that the voting protocols under study become hard to                 manipulate at 3 candidates, 4 candidates, 7 candidates,                 or never.",

First, a                 connection is established between approximating the                 size of the largest clique in a graph and multi-prover                 interactive proofs. Second, an efficient multi-prover                 interactive proof for NP languages is constructed,                 where the verifier uses very few random bits and                 communication bits. Last, the connection between                 cliques and efficient multi-prover interaction proofs,                 is shown to yield hardness results on the complexity of                 approximating the size of the largest clique in a                 graph.\par Of independent interest is our proof of                 correctness for the multilinearity test of functions.",

The                 complexity for a problem with m constraints and word                 length of L digits is bounded by the maximum of two                 values. The first, which is O(mlogm) steps, is a bound                 on the complexity of finding the convex region bounded                 by the constraints, each step being an arithmetic                 operation or a compare. The second, which is O(mL)                 steps, is the complexity of solving m                 greatest-common-divisor problems. The algorithm finds a                 minimal binding set of constraints for any given                 problem, in addition to finding the solution set. A new                 method of solving three constraint problems is                 introduced.",

Although                 this change has been predicted for a long time, trends                 in technology and growth in the literature are making                 this transition inevitable. It is likely to occur in a                 few years, and is likely to be sudden. This article                 surveys the pressures that are leading to the impending                 change, and makes predictions about the future of                 journals, publishers, and libraries. The new electronic                 publishing methods are likely to improve greatly                 scholarly communication, partially through more rapid                 publication, but also through wider dissemination and a                 variety of novel features that cannot be implemented                 with the present print system, such as references in a                 paper to later papers that cite it."
